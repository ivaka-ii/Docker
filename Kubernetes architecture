Kubernetes architectures
========================================

Core concepts
========================================
Worker Nodes		-- host application as containers
Master Node			-- Manage, plan, schedule monitor nodes 

Master node contains control plane components

All information from control plane is stored in ETCD cluster

Kube scheduler 		-- represents the docker uploader to the different working nodes based on it's size and capabilities

Kubernettes Controller Manager
	Node-controller 	-- it is responsible for the nodes itself
	Replication-controller	-- it is responsible for how many replica's is needed on demand and running
	
Kube-apiserver		-- the component that connects all the kubernetes components into one
					it gives the users API calls to the components withtin the architecture

Within Kubernetes everything should be container based or compatible, so in this manner we need 
docker container runtime engine (docker or rkt container)

Kubelet is listening for instructions from the kube api-server
!It is also giving timely reports on the health and conditions of the worker nodes

Kube-proxy 		-- service that ensures the reachability withtin the different working nodes components

ETCD
------------------------------------------
ETCD is a distributed key-value store that is Simple, Secure & Fast

key-value database has only two colums, consist of key and value 
!You cannot have duplicate keys as such.
Used to store small chunks of data for read/write for reading configuration and etc.
